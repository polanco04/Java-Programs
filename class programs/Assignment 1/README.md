# Program 1
This program simulates the Texas Lottery.
6 numbers between 1-54 are randomly generated.
Enter your own 6 numbers between 1-54 and see how many you match!

I didnt implement any "prize" message or anything of the sort. 
Might do so later on.
For now it only has a message that tells you how many numbers you matched.
